# Project blueprint
The brief idea is to preserve Cantonese cultural heritage through digital methods. It's actually a mature process to save and present cultural heritage already, but more specifically, for the detailly local culture of the "Guangdong" area, there are still many of them that are left over.
# Questions
## The subjects (_answer for "what" and "why"_)
Cultural heritage is a wide concept. It includes countless subjects which could and should be cared about, which means it is hard to cover every single form of it.<br><br>
So for now, what I want to care about are mostly the local **dialect**, including Cantonese, Hokkien, Hakka, and other minorities in Guangdong. Majorly because the existing situation for the local dialects is not that positive as before due to some reasons. In other words, the dialects is the main reason inspired me about the idea of doing preservation.<br><br>
But it doesn't mean that I didn't want to cover other forms of cultural heritages around the area, what can be covered including the architectures, dramas(including music), local literature, arts and folk belief, a virtual library would be fine for preserving and presenting them.
## The times (_answer for "when"_)
There is a long history for those heritages above, espically for the drama, achitectures and literature, but for dialects, the most significant change happens during the early modern era of time, so I would be focusing on this period for now.
## The location and people (_answer for "where" and "who"_)
As it is meantioned above, I will be focusing on Cantonese cultural heritages, which means the place I will focus on is "Guangdong", but it is not limited, I would said it can be extend to the whole southern china area, means the people I will discuss about is also related to these area.
# Processes and methods
## My current idea is to creat a virtual library, further idea is to program a LLM with voice function
This might require the use of LLM/AI with speech understanding functions, 3D-Remodeling, and other traditional methods like Image restoration and text recognition
**the details is in the research journal, but that is also a very primary idea**
