# Current Research Ideals

## Brief explanation of the idea
I have introduced that the reason I chose this MA program is to do some preservation of the cultural heritage around the southern China area, especially from my hometown.<br><br>
Since there are various forms of cultural heritage, I decided to focus on a single object for the current period of study, I would preffer to chose **local dialect**. meanwhile, I would also be good to focus on the archives, dramas, architects or other object.

## The specific process to achieve the **preservation**
### Barriers
1. **I actually haven't decided which **method** that is going to be used for my project**<br><br>
    - On the one hand, I haven't decided how to present it
    - On the other hand, I haven't reached or learnt most of the digital methods yet, for example, my python skill is not good enough while the python is an important tool to do **analysis**<br><br>
2. **The **form** of the actual presentation is unsure**<br><br>
    - The local dialect I want to deal with doesn't have a standard character system
    - They do can be present by Chinese characters or Latin alphabet, **BUT !**
        1. For Chinese characters, most of the characters used to present dialect are _**uncommon characters**_ which might not be able to be displayed normally by computer through the _Unicode_
        2. For Latin alphabet system, it is a system only present its pronunciation instead of its meaning<br><br>
3. **The accurate examples/oral record is hard to get**<br><br>
    - For dialect preservation, it is important to get enough examples or the record of that specific dialect, whatever I want to simply save it as an oral recording file, or I want to analyze it maybe for the later development of LLM
    - For some reason, those who can speak fluent and accurate local dialect are getting rarer to be found<br><br>
4. **The communication between _The Selfs_ and _The Others_**<br><br>
    - Besides, if my purpose is to present the cultural heritage, then it will be essential to let _**the others**_ understand it, otherwise it would be less meaningful to preserve it.
    - This can be relate to the second barrier that I listed out up here<br><br>
    
### Ideas
1. A avialable way to do the preservation is building a **digital library** through internet, more specific through the website.<br><br>
    - This might make the program boring since it's only "preservation" but that's a fruqent form to preserve cultural heritage<br><br>
2. Another way is to build a large language model with voice function<br><br>
    - This might be able to enhance oral conversation, which can better present the language(dialect) itself
    - There might be some difficulties for the user to understand when it comes to delivery the meanings since it is a dialect rather than a commonly used language, but we can deal with it through translation function
        - for this method, currently I think there is less availability to achieve it since I haven't made it to use or apply LLM but I'll try anyway<br>

~~Maybe I can try to do it both~~

## Current progress
1. Examples
    - there are some existed digital library built for exhibit the certent cultural heritage
        1. [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/)<br>
        _A comprehensive digital platform that collaborates with museums worldwide to provide 3D virtual tours and open heritage data downloads_
        2. [CyArk](https://www.cyark.org/)<br>
        _Focusing on 3D technology to preserve cultural heritage sites_
        3. [The Louvre online](https://www.louvre.fr/en/online-tours)<br>
        _Provide virtual tours of the Louvre's themed exhibitions_
        4. [IHCHINA](https://www.ihchina.cn/)<br>(China Intangible Cultural Heritage Digital Museum)
        5. [VMTL](https://tlvm.nmtl.gov.tw)<br>(Virtual museum of taiwan literature)
        6. [DMHJNY](https://www.historyofjapaneseinny.org/)<br>(digital Museum of the History of Japanese in NY)
        examples from
        <br><br>
    - there are some open sources program on Github that I think might be helpful for my project
        1. [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice?tab=readme-ov-file)<br> (a voice generation model available for Chinese/English/Cantonese/Shanghainese and other chinese dialect)<br>(but unfortunately its not available yet for  Hokkien which is my target dialect as their demo shows)
        2.  [SenseVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/SenseVoice/tree/main)<br>(a speech foundation model with multiple speech understanding capabilities, its created by the same team above and not available for Hokkien yet)
        3. [TW-Hokkien-LLM](https://github.com/lbh0830/TW-Hokkien-LLM)<br> (a translation LLM for taiwanese Hokkien, but its only designed for text translation, and it is based on the standardization of taiwanese accent of Hokkien which is strongly influenced by japanese due to historical factors)
