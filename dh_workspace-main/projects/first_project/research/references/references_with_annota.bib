6.“通过对新加坡闽南话进行的借词语料搜集和发音调查,本文以新加坡闽 南话里英语借词的语音转换为基础,以此探讨英语的音段在借入新加坡闽南 话之后是如何被改造,总结出元辅音借用在新加坡闽南话里的转换规则” (Yee, 2016, p. 14) The research framework of this article is highly valuable for study, as my research focuses on the Minnan（Hokkien） dialect spoken in Guangdong. Furthermore, the currently existing relatively standardized Minnan dialect system is based on Taiwanese Minnan. Therefore, to apply existing research findings, it is necessary to differentiate between details, accents, and loanwords. Especially given the current situation, we must acknowledge that both Taiwanese and Guangdong Minnan dialects differ to some extent from standard Minnan (generally considered to be the Xiamen-Zhangzhou-Quanzhou accent).
7.“同时,福建闽南话中虽然也有一些马来语的借词, 但是福建闽南话的这些马来语借词不是福建闽南人在与马来族群交流中 吸收的,而多是新加坡、马来西亚甚至包括印尼等地闽南籍华人回福建 省亲时带回去的,而且数量远不如新加坡闽南话的马来语借词多” (Yee, 2016, p. 22) I have firsthand experience with this. The Min Nan dialect spoken in mainland China contains many words not derived from Chinese, but these have been integrated into the language and become part of the speakers' culture. Furthermore, as I've mentioned in research journals, there are differences between Min Nan dialects from different regions. Taiwanese Min Nan is heavily influenced by Japanese loanwords, Southeast Asian Min Nan by Malay and English loanwords, and Min Nan spoken in Guangdong is heavily influenced by Cantonese, while Min Nan spoken in neighboring mountainous areas of northern is influenced by Hakka. These are all factors that need to be considered. I consider this article as primary source material because the author is a native Min Nan speaker in Singapore.

4.“优化博物馆数字展示方式,缓解视觉不适症状” (寇瑞冰 和 易露露, 2025, p. 16) This article is unusual in mentioning the potential discomfort that digital media, digital devices, and digital content may cause to the human body, especially the potential adverse effects on the visual aspect. Although the digital museum sampled in this article is not a "virtual museum" but a physical museum that uses digital means for "preservation" and "presentation," this concern should still be taken into consideration. In particular, compared to physical museums, due to the dematerialization of "virtual museums," visual contact is almost the only way for users to interact with content. Therefore, during the construction process, its "visibility," "readability," and "user-friendliness" are factors that need more attention， specially in terms of eye protection. At the same time, the suitability of the content for children also needs to be considered.

5.“数字媒体时代我国博物馆的交互体验设计” (宁传林 等, 2022, p. 2) this is actually a annotation for the whole paper, it shows a common problem by doing comparison between the Chinese and Dutch museum's interactive exhibition design. it reminds me a thing that i never realized is during the design of the interaction it will be more important to focus on "design" and "creation" rather than "technology", I would highlight it since I'm planning to make a similar virtual exhibition platform.

1.“另外, 非遗保护的 {VR} 应用中, 观众在虚拟环境中的参与性非常重要. “促进参与的一个关键特 征是社交存在” [30]. 如何将现实社交概念引入数字情境中促进参与, 提升体验对非遗传承来说有重要 意义” (马晓娜 等, 2019, p. 129) in my own research design I mentioned that it is important to let the others to understand it, im glad to see my concern is not nonsence
2.“人们倾向于对使用自然语言进行交互的虚拟角色作出反应, 虚拟角色能够与用户交 谈, 回答用户问题, 提供额外的信息并对用户的行为做出回应, 用户通过与虚拟角色的视觉和语音互动 获得信息, 从单纯的观察者、学习者转变为虚拟环境中的积极参与者” (马晓娜 等, 2019, p. 130) through the preservation of cultural heritage it will be much more effective to make it interactive, the most common seen form of that is structural Interactive devices, but nowadays with the development of artificial intelligence, there will be a more interactive method to play a role in the "preservation" or the "exhibition", that is the {LLM}, especially for my concern about the dialect or local languages, it is way more innovational to make a conversational creation to handle it
3.“许多非遗数据库组织借助用户、社群的公共贡献, 带动, 鼓励个人、团体提供非遗数据信 息来扩展数据收集. 欧洲最大的遗产数据库 Europeana 中的很多数据通过民间资源征集获得, 以民众 数据贡献来聚集分散于民间的文化遗产资源” (马晓娜 等, 2019, p. 137) for me, the dialect preservation is also relied on public participant, some less commonly used terms and words are now no longer spoken by young generationwhats more, the preservation of cultural heritage is always depends on the local public participant

10.“latforms should be optimized in order to consume less resources ({CPU}, {GPU}, network load) while keeping great performance and content quality” (Paneva-Marinova 等, 2021, p. 121) This article introduces, or at least one, approach to transforming physical museums into virtual museums, specifically demonstrating the digitization of collections, including 3D rendering and the application of virtual reality technology. It must be acknowledged that the entire article focuses on the specific process or reference of 3D rendering, along with some detailed optimizations, which will be very helpful to my work. It also mentions another detail I hadn't previously considered: the need to consider the computing power of users' devices. After all, the purpose of a virtual museum is "exhibition," so it needs to ensure universality, especially for the general public.

The study is based on an analysis of annual reports of public libraries, a survey of library staff and interviews. It is concluded that although the overall pace of digitization of local history documents is still relatively modest, Latvian public libraries have increased their digitization efforts. Publicly accessible, interactive digital collections and virtual exhibitions are being created to promote cultural heritage. The recent launch of the integration of the digital collections of the public libraries into a single platform - the Digital Library of the National Library of Latvia - is of crucial importance for sustainable preservation and accessibility.},

Highlighting Local Heritage Digital Collections and Virtual Exhibitions in Latvian Public Libraries
8.“However, not all staff are confident in their ability to use digital technologies in library work: 22\% of respondents indicate that they are not sufficient, and 12\% strongly agree and 27\% rather agree with the statement that "there is a lack of information about digital and {AI} tools". Thus, library staff would need additional training and encouragement in the use of digital technologies.” (Valeine 和 Mikuda, 2025, p. 84) In reality, we don't lack the technical personnel specifically tasked with digitization. However, the process of digitizing documents, artifacts, and other collections often requires not only a background in information science but also extensive knowledge in disciplines such as history, archaeology, and even art. Furthermore, because the training of these disciplines has historically been relatively independent, many traditional museum staff lack the necessary knowledge. It's worth noting that this article was published in 2025, indicating that the shortage of such personnel remains relatively severe.

9.“The digital collections offer a wide range of digitized local studies documents: press articles, text documents, manuscripts, photographs, images, greeting cards, drawings, photo albums, letters, posters, images of the paintings, books, booklets, song lyrics, video files and audio files. The most unusual digital documents preserved in the digital collections of public libraries are: photographs of Jewish tombstones - Ludza Town Library collection "Jewish Cemetery" (Ludzas novada bibliotēka, 2025), song leaflets of the traditional Cemetery Festival (Jekabpils Principal Library, 2025), recipes for local milk dishes in photographs, audio and video files (Preiļi Main Library, 2025).” (Valeine 和 Mikuda, 2025, p. 87) I actually have some concerns about the level of public participation, mainly because it presents a dilemma. On the one hand, I'm unsure about public enthusiasm and the reliability of the information they submit, which will affect the workload of relevant personnel. On the other hand, without public participation, the preservation of local culture cannot proceed, a point emphasized in "马晓娜, 图拉和徐迎庆. 《非物质文化遗产数字化发展现状》. 中国科学: 信息科学 49, 期 2 (2019年): 121～42.". However, as mentioned earlier, given the current significant shortage of relevant personnel, finding a balance is also a challenge.
